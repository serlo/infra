# Infrastructure for Serlo

## Introduction

Serlo's infrastructure is based on Terraform, Kubernetes, Google Cloud and Cloudflare.

We currently support the following environments:

1. **https://serlo-staging.dev** (staging environment to test and integrate infrastructure and apps)
2. **https://serlo.org** (production environment)

To get access to our staging environment please contact us.

## Deployment process

The deployment of infrastructure code or new app versions has to be reviewed by the infrastructure unit.

Therefore, please open a new **pull request** into main.
